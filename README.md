# Tabs and datatypes for source analysis in Meggie (work in progress)

## Currently implemented:
* Plotting alignment
* Creating simple inverses for fsaverage template head
* Creating spectrums in source space
* Plotting spectrums with plot\_source\_estimates

## TODO:
* Noise covariance estimation
* Better inverse support (real MRI, batching, other options)
* Group averages and permutation tests for spectrums
* Creation, plotting, group averages and permutation tests for evoked
* Creation, plotting, group averages and permutation tests for TFR

## Contributions
Help appreciated!
